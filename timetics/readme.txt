- Log in to Your WordPress Dashboard: Access your WordPress admin panel.
- Navigate to Plugins: On the left sidebar, click on **Plugins**, then select **Add New**.
- In the search bar at the top right, type **WP Timetics** to find the plugin.
- Install the Plugin: Once you locate WP Timetics in the search results, click the **Install Now** button next to it. WordPress will automatically download and install the plugin.
- After installation, click on the **Activate** button that appears. This will enable the plugin on your site.

### Manual installation

To manually install, download our product from the WordPress directory and upload it to your web server using FTP or CPanel.

### Upgrading

The automatic updates for this plugin function smoothly. However, if you make any customizations to the plugin, be sure to create a backup before updating. In some cases, you may be faced with permalink issues after an update.
